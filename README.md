## Project Description

The Julia Programming Language is the highest-level programming language ever created, so it serves as a gateway to knowledge.

I share my educational videos on YouTube to help make Julia more accessible for a global community of students, educators, hobbyists and professionals.

I share all of my code on GitHub, so everyone has free access to my code.
