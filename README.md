## Project Description

I am a self-taught coder and Julia is my first programming language. If I can learn it, so can you!

The Julia Programming Language is a relatively new language that serves as a gateway to knowledge.

I make educational videos on YouTube to help make Julia accessible to the masses.

I started this project because I had a difficult time finding free resources for beginners when I was trying to learn Julia.

I am sharing my experience with others who may also be struggling to find resources.
