## Project Description

I am a self-taught hobbyist and Julia is my first programming language.

I make free coding tutorials which are intended for students, hobbyists, tinkerers, enthusiasts and amateurs who have no programming experience.

I started this project because I had a difficult time finding free resources for beginners when I was trying to learn Julia. I am sharing my experience with others who may also be struggling to find resources.
